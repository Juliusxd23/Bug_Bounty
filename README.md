# Bug Bounty

This folder will gather write-ups of differents bugs that I found during my Bug Bounty hunt.
The structure will be as follows: "X_DD_MM_YYYY_PROGRAM" where :
- X = the number of the write-up
- DD = the day of the submission of the report
- MM = the month of the submission of the report
- YYYY = the year of the submission of the report
- PROGRAM = the entity where the bug was found

For example : 1_16_02_2025_Nasa is the first write-up, the report submission date of the 16/02/2025 and the report is about Nasa Bug Bounty Program
